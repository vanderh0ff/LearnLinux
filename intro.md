Introduction
============

many courses start with a bit of history on the subject, however I find that it
is the first bit of information to be skipped over and sets a precident of being
full of fluff that doesn't help you learn, so we are going straight in to Linux.
no history.

for this class you will need a Linux distro of your choice. I'm not specifying
one because you are learning Linux not Ubuntu,Fedora,RHEL,...,etc so use
whatever you want. I recommend that you do these exercises in a virtual machine
as you can save and revert changes in them easily, and you will be breaking the
operating system in this course.

the course will try to teach you the following enough that you can use them,
you will not master these things, as I am not a master and can only teach so
much.
