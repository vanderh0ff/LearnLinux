The home directory is where the user will keep their files.
You will probably have a home directory like
`home/myusername`

Now that you are beginning to learn about different directories, let's learn how to change to a new one.
Type **cd** in your terminal to change directory. Follow this command by which directory you want to go to.

Example
`cd /var`

To get back to your home directory, you have a few options.
* `cd /home/myusername`
* `cd ~`
* `cd $HOME`

To go one directory up from the one you are in, try
`cd ..`

To go two up
`cd ../..`

To get back to the directory you were just in
`cd -`

Try playing around with these and see what happens.
