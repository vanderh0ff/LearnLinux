As you will begin to find as you become more familiar with Linux, there are many ways to do things. 
Creating files is no different, but one of the simplest ways is to use the `touch` command.

Using `cd` to change your `pwd` to the one you want to create your file in, simply 

`touch mynewfile.txt`

As you can see in this image, the file test.txt is created.

You can create it in any directory.

And you can create other files as well, like test.jpg. Just remember these will still be empty files.
